Python examples for using Google Earth Engine in QGIS


This repo is a collection of Python examples for the [Google Earth Engine plugin for QGIS](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin). Examples in the [Gena](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin/tree/master/examples) folder were developed by [Gennadii Donchyts](https://github.com/gena), the developer of the GEE plugin for QGIS. Some other examples were adapted from the [Earth Engine API examples](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api/tree/master/python/examples).
