A collection of **200+** Python examples for using Google Earth Engine in QGIS

**Contact:** Qiusheng Wu (https://wetlands.io | qwu18@utk.edu)

## 1. Description

This repo is a collection of Python examples for the [Google Earth Engine plugin for QGIS](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin). Examples in the [Gena](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin/tree/master/examples) folder were developed by [Gennadii Donchyts](https://github.com/gena), the developer of the GEE plugin for QGIS. Some other examples were adapted from the [Earth Engine API examples](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api/tree/master/python/examples).

## 2. Usage

* **Step 1:** [Sign up](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/) for [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/).
* **Step 2:** Install [QGIS](https://qgis.org/).
* **Step 3:** Install the [Google Earth Engine Plugin for QGIS](https://gee-community.github.io/qgis-earthengine-plugin/) and authenticate Google Earth Engine.
* **Step 4:** Git clone or [download](https://github.com/giswqs/qgis-earthengine-examples/archive/master.zip) this repository.
* **Step 5:** Open the Python console in QGIS and load any downloaded Python script into the QGIS Python Editor.
* **Step 6:** Click the *Run script* button on the Python Editor to execute the script.
* **Step 7:** Zoom in/out the QGIS Canvas to inspect the results.
